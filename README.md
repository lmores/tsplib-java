# TSPLIB Java package

This library provides utilities to read files in [TSPLIB](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95) format.
As of version `0.0.1` only `.tsp` files are supported.

This package includes a copy of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances contained in the official TSPLIB archive.

Javadoc is available at [TODO](https://lmores.github.io/doc/tsplib).


## How to

```java
import io.github.lmores.tsplib.TspInstance;
import io.github.lmores.tsplib.TsplibArchive;

String[] filenames = TsplibArchive.extractTspFilenames();
// {Â "a280.opt.tour", "a280.tsp", "ali535.tsp", ... }

TspInstance instance = TsplibArchive.readTspInstance("a280.tsp");
instance.getName()            // "a280"
instance.getType()            // TSP
instance.getComment()         // "drilling problem (Ludwig)"
instance.getDimension()       // 280
instance.getEdgeWeightType()  // EUC_2D
instance.getEdgeWeight(0, 1)  // 20
```


## Notes for TSP instances

Since all TSPLIB instance files for the TSP assume that the underlying graph is complete, edges are not stored explicitly in memory.

Except for the edges themselves, the only value associated with each edge is its weight.
TSPLIB instance files have 13 different ways to encode edge weights (`EXPLICIT`, `EUC_2D`, `EUC_3D`, `MAX_2D`, `MAX_3D`, `MAN_2D`, `MAN_3D`, `CEIL_2D`, `GEO`, `ATT`, `XRAY1`, `XRAY2` and `SPECIAL`).
Of all these possibilities, only the `EXPLICIT` case requires the direct enumeration of all weight values, whereas in all the other cases the weight is computed by a specific function starting from the coordinates of the nodes involved.

Since the number of nodes can be high, when the edge weights format is different from `EXPLICT`, weight values are not stored in memory when an instance is loaded; instead, they are generated on the fly each time the method `TspInstance.getEdgeWeight` is called.
If you need a in memory copy of all the edge weights you can call the methods `TspInstance.materializeEdgeWeights` or `TspInstance.materializeEdgeWeightsMatrix` (see the javadoc for further details).
